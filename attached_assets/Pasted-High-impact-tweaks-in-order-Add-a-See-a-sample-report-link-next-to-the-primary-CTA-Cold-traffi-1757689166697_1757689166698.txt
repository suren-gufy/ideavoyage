High-impact tweaks (in order)

Add a “See a sample report” link next to the primary CTA.
Cold traffic converts better when they can preview the deliverable without leaving the page (modal or new tab). Also helps ad–page message match.

Make the CTA visually dominant and unique.
Use one primary color for the main action and avoid competing styles; minimize secondary links near it. Focus on one most-wanted action.

Keep the advanced fields collapsed by default; show a tiny “+X% accuracy” hint.
This preserves the short-form feel while nudging motivated users to add context—classic progressive disclosure. Use a single-column form layout for speed. 
The Interaction Design Foundation

Capture email during generation (in a progress panel), not before the first click.
Two-step forms and staged capture typically lift completion because the “start” feels easy, then you ask for email when motivation is high. Add a small progress bar. 
Venture Harbour

Place social proof directly under the hero cards.
If you have logos, use them; otherwise add 2–3 photo-backed testimonials. Credibility/social proof on landing pages materially improves conversion.

Tighten the “Improve accuracy” fields.

Keep: Audience (chips), Industry, Geo, Platform.

Move to later (or hide initially): Funding stage.

Consider defaulting Analysis time range to “Past 12 months” (stronger signal for trends) and let power users change it.

Keep Main goal radio—it helps personalize copy later, but make it last.
This reduces perceived complexity (field count is more damaging than step count). 
Baymard Institute

Instrument message match from ads.
Spin lightweight headline variants that mirror each ad group’s promise/keywords (e.g., “AI meal-planning idea? Validate it with real user evidence.”). Ad–page scent improves conversion and Quality Score.

Add a “methodology” micro-modal and keep the hero concise.
Avoid wall-of-text above the fold; link “How it works” to a short modal. Users scan quickly; keep bullets scannable.

Trust signals near checkout (later).
When you add the paid step, include familiar payment logos and a small note on secure checkout; trust seals can lift perceived security.
