The form (fast start, then progressive capture)

Step 1 — minimal start (always visible)

Describe your idea (1–3 sentences) (required)
Placeholder: “AI meal-planning coach that builds weekly menus from pantry photos.”

Keep only one required field to start; minimize cognitive load now, ask for extras later (progressive disclosure and multi-step forms tend to convert better than a big one-pager).

Step 2 — capture during generation (inline panel appears after click)

“We’re scanning sources… Where should we send the link & updates?”

Email (required to save/share)

Role (optional) — Founder / Indie hacker / PM / Agency

Timeline (optional) — Now • This month • Exploring

Two-step / staged forms reduce perceived effort and often lift completion; ask for email while motivation is high (progress bar visible).

Hidden (auto): UTM params, referrer, device, ad creative id → pass to analytics & checkout for attribution and message-match. (Maintain strong ad→page “message match” to improve conversion and Quality Score.)

“What you’ll get” strip (immediately below hero)

Four quick cards (with tiny UI thumbnails):

Evidence chips — “e.g., 23 Reddit threads • 12 reviews • 41 keywords”

Problem clusters — top pains & solution requests (with 2 linked quotes)

Market signals — 12-month trend sparkline (24 months in paid)

Action plan — 90-day GTM + risks (full in paid)

Add subtle “Unlock the full numbers & playbook → $39” footers on each card.

Social proof row (under the cards):

If you have logos, show them; if not, use photo-backed testimonials. (High-profile client logos and authentic photo testimonials are among the most effective social proof types.)

(Keep copy short; link to a “Methodology” modal for details.)

Free vs Paid table (make the value gap obvious)

Free:
• 2–3 full pain clusters (with 2 linked quotes)
• Trend sparkline (bands, no exact numbers)
• 1 competitor row (features summary)
• Personas light + roadmap headings

Paid ($39):
• Exact search volumes, CPC, difficulty + 24-mo trend
• CAC/LTV simulator + payback estimate
• Full competitor matrix (pricing, sentiment, differentiators)
• 90-day GTM plan + risks & kill-criteria
• All sources & exports

FAQ (conversion-oriented)

Why not show all numbers for free? We keep costly data pulls for paid; free still shows real quotes & trend signals.

What sources? Reddit + public reviews + Trends; links included.

Is my idea private? We don’t share your prompt; excerpts are public-source quotes only.

Refunds? If the paid report lacks enough data to decide, we’ll make it right.
